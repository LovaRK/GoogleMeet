Creating a Google Meet-like app using Agora.io SDK and Swift with SOLID principles is a significant undertaking that should take careful planning and execution.

Before starting, it's crucial to understand what SOLID stands for:

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

These principles provide a strong foundation for creating maintainable, flexible, and testable software.

Here's a rough 30-day roadmap to create your app:

Day 1-5: Planning and Setup

1. Start by creating the project in Xcode. Ensure Swift is the selected language.
2. Study the Agora.io documentation and SDK, understand its capabilities and limitations.
3. Design the app's overall architecture based on SOLID principles. This should include deciding on your app's main components, their responsibilities, and how they will interact.
4. Create a list of necessary features (audio/video chat, screen sharing, text chat, user management, etc.). Prioritize them based on their importance.

Day 6-10: User Management and Authentication

1. Create a backend server (using Node.js, Python, Ruby, etc.) to manage users and generate tokens for Agora.io SDK. This is where your Dependency Inversion principle can be applied. Your client app should not be directly dependent on the server-side implementation.
2. Implement user sign-up, sign-in, and management functionality in your app. Remember to follow the Single Responsibility principle by ensuring each class does only one job.

Day 11-15: Implementing Core Chat Features

1. Use the Agora.io SDK to implement core video and audio chat features. This involves joining/leaving channels, muting/unmuting audio, and enabling/disabling video.
2. Remember to follow the Open-Closed Principle and Liskov Substitution Principle here. Your classes should be open for extension (e.g., adding new features later on) but closed for modification. Also, child classes should not break the program if they are used in place of parent classes.

Day 16-20: Implementing Ancillary Features

1. Implement features like screen sharing, text chat, and more. Your design should accommodate these without major changes, according to the Open-Closed Principle.
2. The Interface Segregation principle should also be applied here. Your app should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use.

Day 21-25: Testing and Debugging

1. Thoroughly test your application. This includes unit testing individual classes and features, as well as integration testing to ensure all components work together properly.
2. Debug any issues that arise during testing. You'll likely spend a significant amount of time here.

Day 26-30: Polishing and Final Touches

1. Work on the app's UI/UX, ensuring it's user-friendly and intuitive.
2. Do a final round of testing and debugging.
3. Prepare your app for deployment. This includes setting up proper App Store metadata, taking screenshots, and more.

Throughout the process, remember to version control your work using Git or another VCS.

This is a very high-level roadmap and does not go into the details of implementing each feature or SOLID principles. Each feature implementation would itself require careful planning, design, coding, and testing. It's also important to be flexible and adjust your roadmap as needed. You might find that some features take longer than expected, or that unforeseen challenges arise.

Lastly, building such a complex app in 30 days is a significant challenge, especially if you're working alone. If possible, consider working with a team or extending
